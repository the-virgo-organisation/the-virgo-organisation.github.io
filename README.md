# quantum-ai-integration
Welcome to The Virgo Organisation repository, a dedicated space for exploring the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing (QC). This work focuses on building the foundations for a new era of computational power, specifically through the development of hybrid quantum-classical AI models and algorithms.
